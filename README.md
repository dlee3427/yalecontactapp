# Yale COVID-19 Contact Tracing App by David Yu and David Lee

A COVID-19 Contact Tracing Application designed specifically for Yale's campus. This application tracks all the places that users have been to, alongside corresponding COVID-19 test results that our users manually input, and our application determines other users in the database who may have been infected depending on where they were during the time of day. 

This application also gives you an analytic overview of total active cases on campus, as well as high-risk locations on campus so that Yale students know not to go there.

As a user you can register with your personal email and input details into the form that define who you are on campus. Once you register as a user, you must input a NEGATIVE test result in order to be allowed on campus and be entered into the contact tracing program.

The User Dashboard shows a brief overview of your attributes, locations that particular user has been on campus, and the results of your COVID-19 tests. From here you have access to the functionalities of submitting a new test result or a new location on campus that you've visted at any point. 

If the user has been at a location with a different user who has tested POSITIVE for COVID-19, the user's visits page will show that he/she has been exposed to COVID-19, prompting the user to be quarantined immediately. 

The User, who has registered into the program, also has access to an analytics page which will show all the Active Cases, Recovered Cases, Total Number of Tests Conducted, and Transmissions on Campus. The analytics page will also display all the locations with total number of visits and the transmission rate of the location.
